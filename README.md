# libft

The "libft" repository contains my implementation of the libft library, which provides a collection of commonly used C functions. The project includes the mandatory part, as well as additional bonus functions.

The libft library is an essential tool for future projects at 42School and serves as a foundation for developing more advanced functionalities. It aims to provide a wide range of utility functions that can be used across various projects.

## Features

The "libft" library includes various utility functions, such as:

- String manipulation functions (ft_strlen, ft_strcpy, ft_strcat, etc.)
- Memory allocation functions (ft_memset, ft_bzero, ft_memcpy, etc.)
- Character checking functions (ft_isdigit, ft_isalpha, ft_isalnum, etc.)
- Linked list manipulation functions (ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_front, ft_lstsize, etc.)
- Conversion functions (ft_atoi, ft_itoa, etc.)

Additionally, the project includes bonus functions that provide extra functionalities beyond the mandatory requirements.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local system:
	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/stenterello/libft.git

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:
	```shell
	cd libft

3. Compile the library using the provided Makefile:
	```shell
	make
This command will compile the library and generate the libft.a file.

4. Use the library functions in your code as needed. Refer to the libft.h header file for function prototypes and descriptions.
